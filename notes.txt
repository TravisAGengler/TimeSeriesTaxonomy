Data cleaning
  Same dimensions
  80 x 80 = 6400 px * 3 channels = 19.2 kb
  50 x 50 = 2500 px              = 07.5 kb
  64 x 64 = 4096 px              = 12.2 kb

Approach 1 (A1)
  Row wise concatenation grayscale

Approach 2 (A2)
  Image processing
    Extract features (Lines, colors, etc)
    Filters (Sharpen, blur)
  3 series (1 for each color channel) for 1 sample
  Color histograms

Approach 3 (A3)
  Shape signature

  Localized signature
    This "sweeps" the image in a regular fashion
      Spiral - Hyperparams (revolution radius delta, samples per revolution)
      Star - Hyperparams (max radius, # of points)

    Each sweep sample has (r, g, b)

  Localized texture signature
    Localized signature on sobel filtered image (grayscale)

  Localized color signature
    Localized signature on (r, g, b)

  

  

  Convolution

Evaluation
  Compare against approach 1
  Compare against random
  Compare against state of the art (Alex net)

Deliver
  ROC and metrics for all 6 combos
